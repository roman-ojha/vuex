*)  VueX:
    -> State management & Pattern library
    -> Centralized store for all components
    -> components need to share state in many cases Vuex provides a single source of truth for data/state
    -> No need to pass events up and props down through multiple components
    -> Global state is 'reactive'

*) State:
    -> App-level state/data (todo, posts, token, etc)

*) Getters:
    -> Get pieces of state or computed values from state

*) Actions:
    -> Called from components to commit a mutation

*) Mutations:
    -> Mutate the state (update data, etc)

*) Modules:
    -> Each module can have it's own state, getters, actions & mutations (posts module, auth module, etc)
